        <p>
            I am a recovering digital media professional with twenty five years experience of working
            at the cutting edge of digital media. These days I am more interested in AI, web3 and not working.
        </p>

        <p>
            This blog is nothing more than a place to park my own personal ideas and observations from
            my working life and is not meant as a reflection on any past or current employers.
        </p>

        <p>
            The posts are more designed to help me formulate my thoughts than for any reasons of
            self-promotion but I hope that any readers I may find some value in my ramblings.
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
